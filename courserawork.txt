he that is down need fear no fall
he that is down need fear no fallhe that is down need fear no fall
he that is down need fear no fall
he that is low no pride
he that is humble ever shall have God to be his guide

I am content with what I have
because thou saveth such

tingle tingle little cat 
how are you looking so far
up around you shine so nice
like a diamond in the sky
